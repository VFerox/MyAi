# ADHD Assistant: Study & Task Reminder AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Our ADHD Assistant AI helps students manage assignments, courses, and daily tasks by automatically scheduling study sessions, sending timely reminders, and integrating with calendars. Building AI course project.

## Background

Many ADHD students struggle with time management and organization. This project addresses:
* Missed deadlines and forgotten assignments
* Difficulty in scheduling study hours
* Overwhelm from daily responsibilities

## How is it used?

The solution integrates with calendar apps to auto-schedule study sessions and sends reminders for upcoming tasks. It is designed for students who need extra support in managing academic work and daily responsibilities, providing a user-friendly interface for tracking and organizing tasks.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is primarily user-provided, including assignment details and course schedules, along with integrations via calendar APIs (e.g., [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar)). AI methods include natural language processing for task parsing and predictive scheduling to optimize study hours.

## Challenges

This project does not address the underlying causes of ADHD and depends on the quality of user data. Ethical considerations include ensuring privacy and data security. Additionally, misclassification of tasks and scheduling conflicts may arise.

## What next?

Future improvements could involve:
* Expanding integration with multiple calendar services and productivity tools
* Enhancing NLP for better task interpretation
* Developing a mobile app version  
Assistance in UX design and further AI model training would accelerate progress.

## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration from academic research on ADHD and digital time management tools.
* Gratitude to mentors and peers from the Building AI course for their invaluable guidance.
